# TerraformTools-SPORE-
Adds a bunch of in-game terraforming tools (including objects) to the Adventure Editor.
Briefly about the symbols of the tools:
— The game may crash if, after editing the terrain, you try to add any object from the “Build mode”: I recommend that after working with the terrain, save the planet and restart the adventure.
- (low), (land) or (high) indicate the level of terrain in which they work best.
— Similar tools with (small), (medium) or (large) are slightly different from each other.
(I did not add these designations for some instruments.)
— Collision and effects of objects from the "Objects" section often work after restarting the adventure.
— If the objects are too large, then the collision may not work even after a reboot.
