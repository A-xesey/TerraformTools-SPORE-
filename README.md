# TerraformTools-SPORE-
Mod contains:
- Near 800-1000 in-game terraforming tools.
- New subcategories such as Beaches, Global, Dunes and Objects.
- Global includes tools that change a huge part of the planet terrain or completely all
- Objects includes objects that can be encountered during the game (stones, crashed ship, spice geysers, etc.) + light sources and various test things.
- Planets can be published and shared with others.
- The mod also includes the planet Gonzago from the prototype of the same name! True, without a mod it will not work for others.

Notes:
- The game may crash if, after editing the terrain, you try to add any object from the “Build mode”: I recommend that after working with the terrain, save the planet and restart the adventure.
- (low), (land) or (high) indicate the level of terrain in which they work best.
- Similar tools with (small), (medium) or (large) are slightly different from each other.
- (I did not add these designations for some instruments.)
- Collision and effects of objects from the "Objects" section often work after restarting the adventure.
- If the objects are too large, then the collision may not work even after restarting the adventure.

Special thanks to:
- 0kepOnline for ideas for designing thumbnails of tools!
- Max Games R.S.[/b] for his mod, which inspired me to create my own mod!
